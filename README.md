# arya bot
I made this for some friends in like 5 minutes

**Running the bot**

1.Clone the repository, and make sure you have node installed from https://nodejs.org/

2.Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers/applications then go to bot => create a new bot.

3.Create directory config then create a config.json, open it and put this inside:
{
    "token": COPY AND PASTE THE BOTS' TOKEN HERE WITH DOUBLE QUOTATIONS!
}

4.Open a terminal and in the directory run: node client.js

Enjoy :)
